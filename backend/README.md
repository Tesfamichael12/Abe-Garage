# üöó Abe's Garage Backend

> The robust and scalable backend for the Abe's Garage Management System. Built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL, it provides a secure and efficient API for the frontend application.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This backend provides a comprehensive API for managing all aspects of Abe's Garage operations, including employee management, customer records, vehicle servicing, and business analytics. It's designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.


## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The backend is built following a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, adapted for a headless API:

- **Routes:** Define the API endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods. They are responsible for receiving requests and forwarding them to the appropriate controllers.
- **Controllers:** Handle the incoming requests, validate the data, and call the appropriate services to perform the business logic. They are responsible for sending the response back to the client.
- **Services:** Contain the core business logic of the application. They interact with the database and perform all the necessary operations.
- **Middlewares:** Provide a way to run code before the request reaches the controller. In this application, middleware is used for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected endpoints.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The backend uses a MySQL database with the following schema:

The database schema is designed to maintain referential integrity through foreign key constraints and supports the core business operations of the garage management system.


## Endpoints

All endpoints are protected by a JWT-based authentication middleware, and most require admin privileges.
