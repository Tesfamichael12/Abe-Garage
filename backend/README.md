# üöó Abe's Garage Backend

> The robust and scalable backend for the Abe's Garage Management System. Built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, it provides a secure and efficient API for the frontend application.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This backend provides a comprehensive API for managing all aspects of Abe's Garage operations, including employee management, customer records, vehicle servicing, and business analytics. It's designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to maintain for a production environment.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The backend is built following a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, adapted for a headless API:

- **Routes:** Define the API endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods. They are responsible for receiving requests and forwarding them to the appropriate controllers.
- **Controllers:** Handle the incoming requests, validate the data, and call the appropriate services to perform the business logic. They are responsible for sending the response back to the client.
- **Services:** Contain the core business logic of the application. They interact with the database and perform all the necessary operations.
- **Middlewares:** Provide a way to run code before the request reaches the controller. In this application, middleware is used for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected endpoints.

## üîí Security

The backend is built with security in mind, incorporating several key features to protect against common vulnerabilities:

- **Helmet:** Sets various HTTP headers to secure the app from common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.
- **CORS:** The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy is configured to only allow requests from the deployed frontend, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.
- **Centralized Error Handling:** Ensures that all errors are handled gracefully and consistently, preventing information leaks.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The backend uses a PostgreSQL database. The complete schema, including table definitions and seed data, can be found in `backend/db/initial-schema.sql`.
